    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Tenderized octopus, char-grilled and drizzled with extra virgin olive oil, a squeeze of fresh lemon, and a
        sprinkling of fresh parsley. Simple, yet deliciously satisfying! </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt
        </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon black peppercorns
        </li>
        <li>1 wine cork
        </li>
        <li>3 ½ pounds octopus, head and beak removed
        </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
        </li>
        <li>½ lemon
        </li>
        <li>½ tablespoon minced fresh parsley
        </li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot 1/2 full with water. Add 2 tablespoons kosher salt, peppercorns, and the wine cork; bring
            to a boil over high heat.

        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place octopus on a cutting board. Using a wooden spoon or meat mallet, pound the octopus multiple
            times, starting in the middle and moving down each tentacle to tenderize the meat.

        </li>
        <li>Dip tentacles into the boiling water 3 times, holding them in the boiling water 2 to 3 seconds each time,
            until the tentacles curl up. Submerge entire octopus in the boiling water. Bring water back to a boil,
            reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until octopus is fork-tender, 45 to 60 minutes. Remove from heat and
            cool for 30 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.

        </li>
        <li>Grill octopus until charred on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side.

        </li>
        <li>Remove from heat, slice into pieces, and place on a serving platter. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil,
            squeeze lemon over top, sprinkle with parsley, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.

        </li>
    </ol>
